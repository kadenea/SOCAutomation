# SOC Automation Project

## Summary

In this project I will be congiguring a automated security operations center (SOC) environment. Within this, I will be using applications such as Wazuh for a for my Security and Information Event Management (SIEM) and Cross-layered Detection and Response (XDR). I will also be using TheHive for case management as well as Shuffle for Security, Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) capabilities. The project will be configured on Windows 10 virtual machines using the virtualization hypervisor, VirtualBox.
